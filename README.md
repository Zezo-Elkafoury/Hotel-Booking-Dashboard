# Hotel Bookings Dashboard

## Overview

The Hotel Bookings Dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of hotel booking data, showcasing important metrics and visualizations. This dashboard allows users to explore trends in hotel bookings, success rates of room assignments, and the demographic breakdown of guests.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains various features related to hotel bookings, including:

- **hotel**: Type of hotel (e.g., City Hotel, Resort Hotel).
- **reservation_status**: Status of the reservation (e.g., Canceled, Check-Out).
- **total_guests**: Total number of guests per reservation.
- **adults**: Number of adults in the reservation.
- **children**: Number of children in the reservation.
- **arrival_date**: Date of arrival.

## Dashboard Features

1. **Filter By Year**: Users can filter the data to view metrics for a specific year.
2. **Average Success Rate**: Displays the average success rate of room assignments.
3. **Total Guests by Month**: Visualizes the trend of total guests per month.
4. **Success Rate of Room Assignments**: Compares success rates for different hotel types.
5. **Demographic Breakdown**: Displays the number of adults and children by hotel.
6. **Reservation Status Overview**: Shows the distribution of reservation statuses.

## Visualizations

### Key Visualizations

- **Total Guests by Month**: A line chart showing the trend in total guests over the months.
- **Success Rate of Room Assignments**: A bar chart comparing success rates between City Hotel and Resort Hotel.
- **Demographics**: A bar chart displaying the number of adults and children by hotel type.
- **Reservation Status**: A pie chart illustrating the proportion of different reservation statuses.

## Future Work

- Enhance the dashboard with more granular filtering options (e.g., by hotel location, booking source).
- Integrate machine learning models to predict booking cancellations based on historical data.
- Add additional visualizations for deeper insights, such as revenue trends over time.
